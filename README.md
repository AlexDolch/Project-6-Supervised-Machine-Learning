## Sixth project of the Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School
### Supervised Machine Learning: House Price Prediction

---

As our sixth project we went deep into Scikit-learn, amazing module! Just uploaded how far i came yet, will have to troubleshoot to get this running.
We had a little competition going on in our class about who will get the highest accuracy. So far I didnt manage to finally troubleshoot, to submit any score I quickly modelled something that can be found in the dump folders, the more sophisticated version is in the challenge folder in that dump. Not sure if i wanna continue to beat the highscore, we quickly move on to regression modells...
I was happy to "crack the code" (as my instructor said) at the competition on mushrooms the very last day.
Article on the whole stuf is pretty huge, gonna add link here kinda soon.
