## Sixth project of the Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School
### Supervised Machine Learning: House Price Prediction

---

As our sixth project we went deep into Scikit-learn, amazing module! Just uploaded how far i came ye, will have to troubleshoot to get this running.
We had a little competition going on in our class about who will get the highest accuracy. So far I didnt manage to finally troubleshoot, to submit any score I quickly modelled something that can be found in the dump folders, the sophisticated version is in the project folder. Not sure if i wanna continue to beat the highscore - the classes best scores are around 97% accuracy while i think it should be easy to bugfix till 99,5% acc. - since we only have to predict if houses are expensive or not, not their price. Will update here when i can but for now start writing the article on it, CV and stuff...
