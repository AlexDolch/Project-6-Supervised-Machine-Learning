As our sixth project we went deep into Scikit-learn, amazing module!
You can try to understand my thought processes through this article here:

Machine Learning was one of the coolest things covered so far, i will definitely invest time into commenting all the code here when i find time  
for now it is way to hard to understand. We had several deadlines with way too much to learn which ended up into the most chaotic files i ever had on my laptop.  
I think you can see that i like my stuff ordered in a certain way so i will really feel better when i have done so.
